Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
Return the running sum of nums.


Using Input Array for Output
Intuition

In the previous approach we created an extra array to store our results. However, we do not actually need to do so. We can obtain the same result without using extra space by performing the same operations on the input array instead.

Algorithm

Increase nums[i] by the previous index's running sum. The previous index's running sum is stored at index i-1 in the input array.
We repeat step 1 for all indices from 1 to n-1.


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n)O(n) where nn is the length of input array.

Space complexity: O(1)O(1) since we don't use any additional space to find the running sum. Note that we do not take into consideration the space occupied by the output array.
