Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


Output to Array
Intuition and Algorithm

Put every node into an array A in order. Then the middle node is just A[A.length // 2], since we can retrieve each node by index.
We can initialize the array to be of length 100, as we're told in the problem description that the input contains between 1 and 100 nodes.
